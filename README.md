Sentra runs governed security operations: recursive threat modeling, posture drift detection, policy-gated incident response, and a complete audit trail with actor attribution.

## What Sentra does

- **Posture management** — continuous, drift-aware, controls-mapped.
- **Threat intelligence correlation** — graph joins across feeds and telemetry.
- **Governed incident response** — playbooks gated by policy, sealed in ledger.
- **Recovery readiness** — RTO/RPO modeled, evidenced, exercised.
- **Attribution audit trail** — who saw what, decided what, did what, when.

## Architecture

Sentra is a domain surface on the SZL Holdings platform. Every action is routed through the same governed pipeline:

```
sense → structure → correlate → explain → recommend → approve → execute → proof
```

The execution fabric is [**A11oy**](https://github.com/szl-holdings/a11oy). The bounded-loop kernel underneath every domain pack is [**ouroboros**](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros) — implementing the [Lutar Invariant](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros-thesis) for measurable convergence with auditable closure.

## Status

**Alpha.** Sentra is under active development as part of the SZL Holdings platform. Public releases are tagged via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/szl-holdings/sentra/releases). Security disclosures: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
